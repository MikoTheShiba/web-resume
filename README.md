# web-resume
A resume I made in React and MUI

I mostly made this for practice soooo

## MANDATORY DOCUMENTATION
(because I tend to forget how I did things)

**Running the Resume**

if it's your first time, hit it with the `npm install`

once you've hit the `npm install`, just hit `npm start` to run it and you're done

**Framework:**

Material UI - For most of the style of the application

React - For the whole application

## Basics:

### Areas of Interest:

**-App.js**

Where most of the shebang happens

**-App.css**

Add some funny theme configs

**-RouteData.jsx**

Set up EVERYTHING for Routing and Page Navigation

**-/pages/**

the pages are here

**-/components/**

the stuff makes up the stuff are here

**-/components/barhead/**

is the appbar

**-/components/sidebar/**

is the sidebar on the left of the appbar

**-/components/cards/**

the nice little cards that make up the entire resume


### Adding a New Page:

Step 1: Create a jsx file in pages for your page

Step 2: Set it all up in the RouteData.jsx via imports (pick a cool icon to go with it too)

Step 3: And thats it you're done
